# xamarin-material-drawer

This is an example implementation of the Toolbar and Navigation Drawer patterns with Material Design for Xamarin Android.

It is adapted mostly from http://www.android4devs.com/2014/12/how-to-make-material-design-navigation-drawer.html but is
somewhat modernized and is using the AppCompatActivity instead of the ActionBarActivity and makes sure that the 
navigation drawer always has at least 56dp margin to the right (important for small devices!)

Feel free to use it as a base for anything, and please let me know if you find something wrong, unneccesary another
way to improve it!
